# MGSA-EM (Restart mechanism-based Multilevel GSA) — MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of **MGSA-EM**: a *restart mechanism-based multilevel gravitational search algorithm* (GSA) with competition–collaboration learning and an enhanced restart strategy.

It also includes an **IDE-EDA** (Improved Differential Evolution + Estimation of Distribution Algorithm) module used as a restart operator when stagnation is detected.

## What’s inside

- `MGSA_EM.m`  
  Main MGSA-EM optimizer (multilevel structure + competition/collaboration updates + stagnation handling).
- `IDE_EDA_pop.m` (or `IDE_EDA.m`)  
  Population-level restart operator (DE/current-to-pbest + archive + optional EDA sampling).
- Benchmark wrappers (e.g., CEC2017) depending on your setup.

## Core idea (high level)

MGSA-EM:
1. **Sorts the population** by fitness and partitions it into **multiple layers** (top → bottom).
2. Uses **competitive learning** inside each layer: individuals are paired, producing **winners** and **losers**.
3. Updates:
   - **Losers** learn from winners (+ acceleration term / pbest term).
   - **Winners** learn from upper-layer individuals (+ pbest term and cross-layer guidance).
4. Tracks **stagnation** using a counter per individual (increment if no improvement, reset when improved).
5. When stagnation is severe, a **restart mechanism** is triggered using:
   - **Differential mutation** (DE/current-to-pbest/1), optionally using an **archive**,
   - plus an optional **EDA sampling** step to inject diversity.

## Restart mechanism: how it’s triggered (important)

**Stagnation counters** are maintained per individual. When an individual’s counter exceeds the stagnation threshold `Sg`, the restart mechanism is activated (Algorithm 5–6 in the paper).

In code, you may use either:

### Option A — Individual-level restart (recommended for “only stagnated particles”)
Call the restart operator **only for individuals** with `counter(i) > Sg`.

### Option B — Population-level restart (what you implemented)
Trigger IDE-EDA for the whole population only when a large fraction is stagnated, e.g.:
```matlab
stagRate = mean(counter > Sg);
if stagRate > 0.5
    [fitness,p,...] = IDE_EDA_pop(...);
    counter(:) = 0;
end
